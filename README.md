## About pocketDSLR
pocketDSLR is a bare-bones, point-n-shoot camera application designed for 
Android Lollipop devices. It utilizes the Android 5.0 APIs (v. 21) allowing 
for unique customization and control over the onboard camera. These 
functionalities include, but are not limited to:
* Manipulating shutter speed
* Changing exposure level
* Control ISO levels
* Provide manual fucussing 

The intended goals for pocketDSLR are to:
* Privide manual control of the device's native camera
* Accomplish this in an efficient, fast functioning application
* Allow image manipulation to provide missing camera functionalities. (*TBD*)
